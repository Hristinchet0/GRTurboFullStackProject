                            high-quality repairs to all
                            types of turbochargers for light, light commercial vehicles, buses and road construction
                            machinery. Over the years, our name has become the synonym of success and leadership in the
                            recycling and sale of turbochargers in Bulgaria, proof of which are our satisfied customers

                <p th:text="#{index_p4}">We at GR Turbo have the latest generation high-speed vibro-balance stands for
                    turbochargers. We have
                    stands for high-velocity vibro-balance of medium-speed turbochargers as well as for tuned
                    turbochargers. Our stands work up to 250,000 revolutions per minute. Real-time simulation of the
                    turbocharger's performance in the car. They also monitor oil pressure and temperature as well as
                    vibrations at optimal load and revolutions.</p>
                <p th:text="#{index_p5}">After each turbocharger has passed through our stands, we are authorized to
                    issue a certificate of
                    authenticity and vibro-balance of the turbochargers. The certificate is under ISO standards. After
                    each repair we have issued, a turbocharger warranty card and a certificate of a high-speed stand are
                    issued.</p>

                        TURBOCHARGERS</h2>
                    <p th:text="#{index_p16}">Nowadays it's good to know that balancing is not the final stage of the
                        turbocharger repair
                        process. Modern turbines are a complex mechanism, and the management of their work is a problem,
                        but only for the unprepared.
                        World leaders are: Borg Warner, Garrett, Holset, IHI, Mitsubishi Turbo Systems.
                        According to their competent opinion,it is not possible to repair the turbo variable geometry
                        outside their official garage and to achieve factory quality. And for the most incompetent, it
                        is clear that a specialized equipment is needed. This, of course, is true, but recently we at GR
                        Turbo have a stand, last word on innovative technology solutions.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p17}">It allows us to test and adjust almost all of the turbochargers on the
                        current market.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p18}">With our Cimat Turbo Test Expert, it is not a problem to set and test any
                        variable geometry or
                        wastage turbine.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p19}">It does not matter if the turbo is with an electronic or pneumatic
                        actuator.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p20}">The stand measures the amount of air passed over a unit of time through
                        the variable geometry
                        and simultaneously counts the turbine speed.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p21}">Another important factor is that the turbocharger is lubricated with oil
                        under the necessary
                        temperature and pressure, mimicking precisely the work of the turbo in the car. All important
                        parameters for the optimal work of the turbo are monitored after reparation by measuring and
                        analyzing.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p22}">Each repair is completed by testing and adjusting the actuator and the
                        stop bolt. This is
                        necessary because most of the modern tubular compressors are controlled and monitored by complex
                        mechanisms - electronic and pneumatic actuators, position sensors and even combined ones (vacuum
                        actuator and position sensor in one). The unloading valve controls the unloading mechanism.
                        Modern turbines feature an electronic actuator, a combination of electric motor and precision
                        electronics such as Hella, VDO / Siemens, Mitsubish, Sonceboz and others. The actuator
                        determines when and how much the variable geometry or wastegate of a turbine without geometry
                        can be opened or closed.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p23}">From what has been said so far, it is necessary to conclude that in order
                        for a turbine to work
                        properly, the correct condition is a working actuator and variable geometry, and this is just a
                        piece of the strength of our Cimat Turbo Test Expert.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p24}">The electronics also have defects - most often we encounter broken
                        reducing agents or defective
                        electronics, leading to incorrect control, turbocharger bad operation and power loss</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p25}">Fine tuning is a must when replacing any types of actuators. Failure to do
                        so will cause the car
                        to be in an emergency mode.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p th:text="#{index_p26}">Our database, containing parameters for turbine tuning, operation and
                        performance, is
                        continually being enriched. We aim for a 100 percent match in the settings set by the
                        manufacturer. The stand counts the fatigue of the actuator, worn connections between the bearing
                        body and variable geometry, and at the same time shows in real terms what adjustments are to be
                        made for the correct adjustment.</p>

                <p th:text="#{index_p27}">We at GR Turbo have the latest generation high-speed vibro-balance stands for turbochargers. We have
                    stands for high-velocity vibro-balance of medium-speed turbochargers as well as for tuned
                    turbochargers. Our stands work up to 250,000 revolutions per minute. Real-time simulation of the
                    turbocharger's performance in the car. They also monitor oil pressure and temperature as well as
                    vibrations at optimal load and revolutions.</p>
                <br>
                <p th:text="#{index_p28}">After each turbocharger has passed through our stands, we are authorized to issue a certificate of
                    authenticity and vibro-balance of the turbochargers. The certificate is under ISO standards. After
                    each repair we have issued, a turbocharger warranty card and a certificate of a high-speed stand are
                    issued.</p>
